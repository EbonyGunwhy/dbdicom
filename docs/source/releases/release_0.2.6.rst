dbdicom 0.2.6
=============

Version 0.2 of `dbdicom` was a protoype version aiming to improve 
stability of the code and identify a suitable setup for a more 
final structure and API. It has been applied in running projects 
but is not longer supported and will be phased out.

Version 0.2.6 is the last stable version with this API. Future versions 
will not be backwards compatible.
